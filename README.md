#Movie Trailer Website

This is a project done by Unnar Thor Bachmann in the Udacity's full stack web developer nanodegree program. This is a multiuser blog page. Each user can read and like the blogs of other users as well as edit and delete their own. Each user has to signup and log into to access the blogs. For any unsuspected usage of the system the user is directed to the login page.

##Short explanation of functionality.

This project was made using the [Google App Engine Python](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/) as well as the template framwork [jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/). I added [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) to improve the front experience of the user. 

##How to run the webpage.

1. [Download](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/downloads) the Google App Engine Python.
2. Start the files in the zipped folder as a new project. 
3. To run the project locally in your browser run the program using the App Engine and view it in the browser with the url localhost:<port>.
4. To run the program online you must sign up for an [account](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/) and deploy the project.
